# Map Safety Places

## Project Description

Map Safety Places is a project aimed at allowing users to mark safe places on the map with markers and leave short comments about them. The project serves to denote unsafe places on the map, allowing other users to find out what happened there. The project is especially useful for charities and foundations.
